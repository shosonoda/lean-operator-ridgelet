# FLT Fujisaki module build profile

Status: exploratory workstation experiment, 2026-08-08. This records target
selection and the persistent-worker result; it is not a regression threshold.

## Scope

The workload is the isolated `.olean` phase behind Lake's
`FLTBlueprint.Chapters.FujisakiProject` job. It excludes compilation of imports,
generated C, native objects, and executables. The measurements use FLT revision
`e4f1595` with `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0-rc1`. Both worktrees started from
Verso Blueprint revision `2c18ef309c3810bc0e53a7e9214a8ea59c2f86d9`;
the candidate implementation was subsequently published as
`708978dfaa6a85ed3f1eac30df1bf83aa6b5be2b` after rebasing.

Local raw evidence is under the root checkout at
`_out/persistent-katex-worker/profiles/fujisaki/`. The earlier baseline evidence
is under `_out/profile-flt-traversal/profiles/flt-html-escape-016/`.

From the FLT checkout, the candidate profile used this command shape, with
`<verso-blueprint>` replaced by the candidate worktree path:

```sh
<verso-blueprint>/scripts/lean-low-priority lake env lean \
  FLTBlueprint/Chapters/FujisakiProject.lean \
  -o /tmp/fujisaki-profile.olean -i /tmp/fujisaki-profile.ilean \
  --profile -Dprofiler.threshold=10 \
  -Dtrace.profiler=true -Dtrace.profiler.threshold=1 \
  -Dtrace.profiler.output=/tmp/fujisaki-profile-firefox.json
```

## Result

The persistent worker removes the repeated Node and KaTeX startup cost while
keeping math lint enabled. In comparable structured-profile runs, it reduced
wall time from 24.21s to 12.44s (-48.6%), runtime interpretation from 19.2s to
5.96s (-69.0%), and system CPU from 11.09s to 2.01s (-81.9%). Its wall time is
within run-to-run noise of the 13.00s lint-disabled control.

| Measurement | Original linter | Lint disabled | Persistent worker |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Wall time | 24.21s | 13.00s | 12.44s |
| User CPU | 14.94s | 11.38s | 11.14s |
| System CPU | 11.09s | 2.72s | 2.01s |
| Runtime interpretation | 19.2s | 4.97s | 5.96s |
| Imports | 2.75s | 4.15s | 2.93s |
| Peak RSS | 4,567,868 KiB | 4,565,448 KiB | 4,734,280 KiB |

The persistent-worker profile's first `Informal.Math.inlineMathExpand` call took
137ms, including lazy worker startup and the first KaTeX module load. Each of
the other 134 calls was below the profile's 10ms reporting threshold. With the
original linter, the 135 calls took 15.20s in aggregate.

Peak RSS was about 163 MiB higher in this candidate run. Workstation RSS and
wall measurements vary, so this observation should be checked by a dedicated
benchmark before treating it as a regression.

## Uninstrumented paired runs

Two interleaved, uninstrumented control/candidate pairs were collected while
the workstation load was falling. The absolute wall times are noisy, but the
system-CPU and page-fault reductions consistently show the removed process
startup work.

| Run | Wall | User CPU | System CPU | Minor faults | Peak RSS |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original 1 | 37.37s | 23.91s | 16.34s | 985,060 | 4,523,220 KiB |
| Worker 1 | 17.67s | 16.45s | 3.48s | 137,400 | 4,699,636 KiB |
| Original 2 | 33.76s | 20.89s | 15.25s | 986,740 | 4,530,056 KiB |
| Worker 2 | 9.88s | 8.68s | 1.89s | 134,487 | 4,703,100 KiB |

The worker reduced wall time by 52.7% and 70.7% in the two pairs, system CPU by
78.7% and 87.6%, and minor faults by about 86%.

## CI corroboration

The v4.32 reference-Blueprint workflow independently exercised the same FLT
source revision, `bc09f1e5ce35d6418173386b5f134b51a81e6c17`. Lake reported
`FLTBlueprint.Chapters.FujisakiProject` at 30s in the
[base job](https://github.com/leanprover/verso-blueprint/actions/runs/31261292723/job/93112402344)
and 14s in the
[candidate job](https://github.com/leanprover/verso-blueprint/actions/runs/31262165786/job/93116039081),
a 53.3% reduction that agrees with the isolated workstation result.

This is corroboration of the module-level effect, not a controlled whole-build
measurement. The candidate's complete reference-generation step was also
shorter (12m43s versus 19m39s), but the base job rebuilt substantially more FLT
dependencies, so cache state explains an unknown portion of that difference.

## Cause and implementation

The original exact-payload cache did not help Fujisaki's 135 mostly unique
formulas. Each miss started a fresh Node process, loaded KaTeX, validated the
shared prelude and one formula, wrote one JSON response, and exited.

The replacement keeps one best-effort worker per Lean process:

- Lean starts an embedded Node worker, initializes it once from Verso's public
  embedded KaTeX string, and then serves sequential newline-delimited JSON
  requests over piped stdin/stdout.
- The worker caches prelude validation by trimmed prelude string.
- Lean retains the exact-payload result cache and serializes concurrent requests
  with a lazily initialized mutex.
- A spawn, transport, or protocol failure marks linting unavailable for the rest
  of the Lean process, preserving the existing non-fatal behavior without
  repeatedly trying to restart a broken worker.

The embedded bootstrap preserves this measured persistent-worker design while
removing filesystem lookup of both the Blueprint worker and Verso's KaTeX
distribution. The worker input is declared to Lake, so its contents participate
in Blueprint's artifact key.

Live process inspection during the FLT run showed one worker child of Lean. The
worker exited when Lean closed its stdin, and no Node process remained after the
compile.

## Validation

- The focused Lean math-lint test covers valid and invalid source spans, invalid
  preludes, concurrent calls, and repeated use of one invalid prelude.
- The focused test also passes with a deliberately unavailable `node` command.
- The JavaScript entrypoint passes `node --check`, and the Lean tests exercise
  its embedded bootstrap and worker protocol.
- Fresh default and alternate-`packagesDir` consumer builds pass with the Lake
  artifact cache enabled and `LAKE_RESTORE_ARTIFACTS=false`.
- `VersoBlueprint` builds successfully with the FLT RC1 toolchain, and the
  isolated Fujisaki compile completes with math lint enabled.

## Remaining targets

With math lint no longer dominant, the earlier lint-disabled drill-down selects
external-declaration snapshot construction as the next Blueprint-specific
target. Configuration resolution spent 1.217s in the nested run; a diagnostic
control retaining name resolution while bypassing the full snapshot reduced it
to 0.010s. The next step is to separate name/status lookup, source and Git
provenance, and declaration-HTML rendering before choosing what to defer or
cache. Preview-value evaluation, measured at 0.647s, follows it.
