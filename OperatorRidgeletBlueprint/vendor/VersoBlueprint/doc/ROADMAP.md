# Blueprint Roadmap

Last reviewed: 2026-08-23

This document tracks repository-local engineering work for `verso-blueprint`.
Scoped planning cards live under [`roadmap/`](./roadmap/). Requests that should
eventually move into upstream `verso`, Lake, Lean, or a related upstream package
are indexed in [`roadmap/README.md`](./roadmap/README.md).

This is not the place for operational commands, option reference material, or
architecture narrative. Those live in
[`MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md`](./MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md),
[`MANUAL.md`](./MANUAL.md),
[`API.md`](./API.md), and
[`DESIGN_RATIONALE.md`](./DESIGN_RATIONALE.md).

## Working Principles

1. keep one semantic source of truth for Blueprint data and status derivation
2. keep command, traversal, generated-data, and browser-runtime paths aligned
   through shared library APIs
3. broaden regression coverage before large structural splits
4. keep the public maintainer harness small, explicit, and repository-local
5. treat upstream workarounds as temporary and name the upstream API that would
   remove them

## Active Workstreams

### Rendering and Preview Boundary

Goal: keep Blueprint's render entry point thin while making preview delivery
predictable across graph, summary, code, citation, and widget surfaces.

Current shape:

1. Blueprint generators call
   `Informal.PreviewManifest.blueprintMainWithPreviewData`.
2. Verso still owns traversal, TeX, word counts, search, page shell, and HTML
   emission.
3. Blueprint owns asset injection, public-xref filtering, preview-data
   emission, and local upstream-workaround rewrites.

Work:

1. keep the landed preview-source consolidation intact: one-label preview
   callers, traversal preview enumeration, and finished manifest entry queries
   go through shared helpers; `PreviewSource` owns statement/proof selection,
   traversal store helpers own whole-domain decoding, and
   `PreviewManifest.File` owns client-facing manifest filters and label lookup
2. merge the traversal preview cache and widget `elabStx` preview path behind a
   phase-safe representation
3. keep preview labels and titles on the canonical manifest-backed path; new
   renderers should consume resolved manifest titles instead of mixing raw
   labels, source labels, and local fallbacks
4. keep graph, summary, relation-panel, Slides, custom-client, and
   inline-reference behavior on shared browser helpers where the interaction
   model is genuinely shared; the current surfaces, descriptors, trigger
   binding, dismissal, popover, slide cleanup, and resize/scroll lifecycles
   already use shared runtime helpers
5. continue toward a lighter preview delivery path so a page does not always
   fetch and decode the full shared manifest for a small number of previews;
   group membership is already normalized into one shared catalog, so the next
   high-value split is lazily delivered Lean `codeData`
6. remove remaining browser timing workarounds only after targeted browser tests
   prove the replacement path; panel lifecycle workarounds should stay behind
   runtime helpers rather than feature-local listeners
7. continue splitting the large preview runtime only along the component-like boundaries now
   encoded in its API tiers: data/cache lookup, fragment rendering and
   hydration, template descriptors, preview surface state, lifecycle binding,
   and readiness/debug hooks. Each split should keep the generated ESM
   `createPreview()` API, generated page runtime, and slide runtime working, then
   move private helpers in this order:
   - readiness/bootstrap and render API installation
     (landed as the current `Commands/preview-runtime-api.mjs` API chunk)
   - manifest/cache loading, status, and entry lookup
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-data.mjs`, emitted as ESM for Manual
     pages and slide decks)
   - generated-data URL and preview-key primitives shared by generated page
     runtime and ESM clients
     (landed as `blueprint-preview-core.mjs`, shared by the generated page
     runtime and public ESM APIs; runtime stores
     still live in `Commands/preview-runtime-data.mjs`)
   - fragment and canonical-node resolution plus diagnostic rendering
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-render.mjs`, emitted as ESM for
     Manual pages and slide decks)
   - hydration registry and math/feature hydrator dispatch
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-hydration.mjs`, emitted as ESM for
     Manual pages and slide decks)
   - template descriptor binding for Lean-emitted preview triggers
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-template.mjs`)
   - preview surface state, slots, and content updates
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-surface.mjs`)
   - lifecycle binding for trigger events, dismissal, pointer checks,
     repositioning, and keep-open checks
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-lifecycle.mjs`)
   - debug hooks used by tests and local inspection
     (landed as `Commands/preview-runtime-base.mjs`)
   - graph runtime utilities such as option normalization, canvas sizing,
     graph block state, script loading, and graph-specific panel positioning
     (landed as `Commands/graph-runtime-core.mjs`, imported by the Manual page
     runtime, emitted for `api/graph.mjs`, and retained by the classic slide
     adapter where needed)
   - graph rendering orchestration, variant selection, and graph UI event
     binding
     (landed as `Commands/graph.mjs`, imported by the Manual page runtime,
     emitted for `api/graph.mjs`, and retained by the classic slide adapter)
8. deduplicate the public JSDoc API object typedefs once the documentation and
   declaration toolchain can express typedef composition cleanly. Today
   `BlueprintPreviewApi` repeats the data API methods from `BlueprintDataApi`:
   TypeScript accepts intersection typedefs, but JSDoc/Docdash rejects `&`,
   while JSDoc-native `@augments` on a typedef is rejected by TypeScript. Keep
   the public type list contract-backed, generate the JSDoc linker data from
   it, and keep generated declaration/docs checks in CI so this explicit
   duplication does not silently drift or collapse to broad types.
9. after the source metadata API stabilizes, expand the compact generated
   source previews into fuller VBP-rendered review interfaces that consume
   manifest `sourceDocuments` and `entry.sources`; keep PDF viewers, text
   excerpts, and crop overlays out of the browser API contract
10. keep the landed source metadata resolver on the data-layer path:
   `api/preview.mjs` delegates source-provenance lookup through the same data API
   primitive as `api/data.mjs`, so preview-key/manifest-entry input
   normalization, missing-entry reasons, source-document joins, and source-ref
   normalization semantics have one runtime owner.
11. keep the landed runtime-side semantic-only preview handling aligned with
   generated-data finalization. Generated JSON clears traversal preview
   candidates that lack cache bodies; page-local relation-panel markup and
   embedded graph-block JSON are still derived during traversal, so browser
   runtimes distinguish `semantic-preview-body-missing` from stale or broken
   cache loads. A later Lean-side pass may pass preview availability into
   page-local relation and graph rendering earlier, but should preserve this
   runtime distinction.
12. keep the external-declaration hover transfer behind its current local
   bridge until the portable-fragment contract tracked by
   [`UPC-0014`](./roadmap/cards/UPC-0014-portable-hover-fragment-transfer/README.md)
   lands upstream; then remove Blueprint's local marker/rewrite machinery.

### Data Model and Status Semantics

Goal: make Blueprint state, traversal stores, and status rendering share one
model instead of recomputing similar facts in several layers.

Work:

1. continue the deduplication pass after source provenance lands. The first
   cleanup moved shared manifest-entry predicates, queryability, and rendered-body
   requirements onto `PreviewManifest.Entry`; remaining candidates include
   repeated traversal-store decoding and validation-message assembly patterns
   across preview, source, and status data
2. keep `Informal.Environment.InProgress` separate from `Data.Node` while it
   owns directive-stack state and typed preview blocks; attribute docstring term
   syntax belongs only to persisted `InformalData`
3. keep `Informal.Environment.State` as the persisted semantic store and
   traversal indexes as rendered-site projections; consolidate only if the
   replacement keeps numbering, hrefs, preview ids, and HTML-cache keys
   phase-safe
4. extend the centralized declaration-level presentation in
   `ProvedStatus.presentation` into a broader node-health record derived from
   `Data.Node` plus external declaration checks; declaration rows, summary
   detail rows, heading marks, code-entry icons, and external-code rows already
   share the declaration-status vocabulary
5. encode the intended ownership rules for `CodeRef.external`, especially the
   difference between Blueprint-owned labels and Lean-owned declaration names
6. decide whether richer group metadata belongs in the core data model, then
   either port the local `group-metadata-rendering` work or retire it
7. reject invalid nested and duplicate declarations before they mutate the
   active environment stack
8. keep imported duplicate collision checks for node labels, group labels, and
   author ids covered by sibling-import and transitive-import tests
9. revisit external declaration footer/status semantics once out-of-workspace
   declarations are represented precisely enough to distinguish declaration
   completeness from dependency completeness

### Asset and Build Reliability

Goal: make generated browser assets rebuild predictably without relying on
manual source touches or stale cached owner modules.

Current state:

1. filtered Lake inputs attached to the `VersoBlueprint` library with `needs`
   make embedded-asset changes and artifact-cache keys correct
2. the harness no longer mutates owner mtimes, deletes cached outputs, or
   materializes canonical `.olean` files
3. v4.33 asset-cache experiments covered changed and restored assets plus
   cache-in-place generation through both `lake lean` and `lake exe vbp build`,
   with 90/90 `vbp check` results while `LAKE_RESTORE_ARTIFACTS=false`
4. maintainer commands share a repository-local cache partitioned by the
   nearest exact Lean toolchain while keeping every `.lake` directory private
5. isolated project-template and real FLT integrations demonstrated large
   cold-to-warm improvements while retaining cache-in-place artifacts and
   passing `vbp check`; UPC-0020 owns the detailed measurements
6. Lean Beam opened, synchronized, and served semantic hover data for a VBP
   source module with restoration disabled and canonical dependency `.olean`
   files absent
7. the paired v4.32 validation covered a cold build, a build-tree-free warm
   replay, a fresh downstream project-template generation, Lean Beam, and an
   asset-change/restore cycle; all passed with artifact caching enabled and
   restoration disabled
8. MathLint embeds its declared Node worker and consumes Verso's embedded KaTeX
   value, removing package-root and `.olean`-location inference; fresh default
   and alternate-package consumers pass through Lake with restoration disabled
9. an isolated integration test changes a declared embedded asset, removes the
   private build tree between builds, verifies the output for both asset
   versions, and confirms that restoring the original succeeds without rebuilding

Work:

1. pursue module-level Lake input dependencies through UPC-0019 so one asset
   change does not invalidate every module in the library
2. keep generation Lake-backed so cached artifact paths remain usable without
   forcing all artifacts into `.lake/build`; external filesystem consumers can
   opt into `LAKE_RESTORE_ARTIFACTS=true`, while the remaining editor boundary
   is tracked through UPC-0020
3. keep direct contract tests between discovered textual `include_str`
   references and the root and standalone-project Lake input declarations
4. retire the local artifact-cache wrapper once UPC-0021's Lake-native,
   workspace-local configuration and administration surface is available

### Validation and Reference Catalogs

Goal: protect behavior before refactors and keep reference output useful as a
release signal.

Work:

1. keep targeted Lean tests for traversal indexes, preview schema, duplicate
   imports, status semantics, and rendering helpers
2. keep browser coverage for graph previews, summary previews, bibliography
   citations/backrefs, widget statement previews, and shared-manifest failure
   diagnostics
3. keep reference blueprint generation and validation distinct from small
   browser-regression fixtures
4. add direct regression coverage for preview-key normalization and JSON roundtrips
5. add low-cost Python coverage for harness manifest, path, and worktree logic
   so routine harness changes do not require full example rebuilds
6. add PR preview deployment that reuses the assembled reference `_site`
   artifact from CI instead of rebuilding the sites in a separate preview-only
   workflow

### Template and Client Delivery

Goal: give users a stable starter project and deployment path without making
client repositories depend on maintainer-only harness commands.

Work:

1. keep a local in-repo template/example as the documentation-facing source of
   truth for project shape, authoring patterns, and generator wiring
2. land the planned smaller starter example and reusable template
3. land `lake exe bp new` as the user-facing project creation command
4. keep `lake exe vbp build` as the documented generation interface for
   existing projects
5. add a template-owned GitHub Pages workflow and local CI script, then test the
   template as a fresh standalone repository
6. keep the maintainer harness out of the user-facing template CI contract
7. evaluate a dedicated `verso-blueprint` GitHub Action after the template
   workflow contract settles
8. keep local smoke coverage and one real GitHub-hosted canary deployment
   separate from routine PR validation

### Harness and Release-Line Maintenance

Goal: keep repository maintenance flows reproducible while avoiding public
workflow details in user-facing docs.

Work:

1. keep `branch-policy.json` as the source of truth for release targets,
   default-development, and backport behavior
2. keep linked worktree metadata local under `.worktrees/`
3. keep shell wrappers thin; keep Python harness modules as the source of truth
   for orchestration, path logic, release checks, and project catalogs
4. keep the project catalog explicit and small, with published reference
   targets plus opt-in ephemeral GitHub checkout coverage
5. validate both root-checkout and linked-worktree flows end to end
6. stabilize output-path conventions for generation, static checks, browser
   checks, and published reference catalogs
7. add the minimum local override surface needed to test a local `verso`
   checkout or an external Blueprint project without hand-editing manifests
8. retire local workaround branches promptly once their content is either
   landed, deliberately ported, or recorded in this roadmap
9. keep PR and backport scaffolds branch-level: default-development PRs should
   pass an intentional branch title to `prepare-pr`, and paired backport
   scaffolds should read the public title of `--main-pr` instead of inheriting
   the last local commit subject

## Design Candidates

These are useful ideas, but they should not displace the active workstreams
above until the semantics are clearer.

1. split `blueprint_summary` into a user-facing overview/work-queue page and a
   maintainer-oriented audit/dashboard page
2. keep the default summary focused on progress, blockers, and next ready work;
   move owner/tag rollups, dependency insights, and metadata audit to the
   maintainer view
3. use compact status chips in summary and work-queue rows
4. revisit graph layout with a CSS-first page architecture so canvas sizing is
   less runtime-driven
5. improve the default font family used by generated Blueprint output
6. add Blueprint-specific search affordances only if Verso's generated search
   cannot cover the needed workflow
7. support per-chapter commands if real projects need chapter-local generated
   pages or diagnostics
8. attach source metadata to nodes where it improves navigation or maintenance

## Risks to Watch

1. silent divergence between local and global status rendering
2. preview regressions that compile-only checks will not catch
3. imported duplicate collisions for labels, groups, or authors
4. workflow drift across long-lived worktrees and branches
5. tracked local-worktree bookkeeping leaking into public repository files
6. drift between the documented template, any exported external template, and
   the eventual GitHub Action contract
