Removal target: copied Slides output loop and local slide asset payload code
Related cards: UPC-0004, UPC-0005

## Summary

Verso Slides should expose a reusable traversal/render/output pipeline so
Blueprint can transform traversed slide nodes, seed the initial hover state, and
suppress the success message without copying `slidesMain`.

## Impact

Blueprint slide decks need Blueprint preview fragments inside Slides output and
need the generated `-verso-docs.json` to start from the rendered-fragment cache's
hover payload table. The current local path mirrors upstream output logic to
thread that data through.

## Roadmap Decision

Track as an upstream `verso-slides` API request. Keep the local wrapper until
Slides exposes the downstream traversal transform, initial-hover-state, and
quiet-output hooks needed to reuse its output writer.

## Reproduction Status

Covered by Blueprint slide-deck generation and browser validation rather than a
standalone upstream repro.

## Preliminary Analysis

The extension point should let downstream packages customize the traversed
document, provide an initial hover state, and choose quiet output while
preserving upstream asset validation and output writing.

## Scope Boundary

These hooks form one card because they are all needed to remove the same copied
`slidesMain` loop. Static runtime asset declaration belongs to UPC-0004, and
head injection is already resolved by UPC-0005.

## Expected Behavior

Blueprint can transform `{blueprint_node}` blocks into slide fragments, pass the
initial hover payload table to upstream rendering, and keep `quiet := true`
behavior while delegating asset validation and all output writing to Slides.

## Evidence

- Local workaround:
  `VersoBlueprint.Slides.slidesMainWithBlueprintPreviews`
- Local removal targets: `SlideAssetPayload`, `recordSlideAsset`,
  `collectSlideAssets`, and the copied output loop in `VersoBlueprint.Slides`.

## Current Workaround

`VersoBlueprint.Slides.slidesMainWithBlueprintPreviews` rewrites
`{blueprint_node}` blocks from Blueprint manifest/cache data to
`VersoSlides.BlockExt.ofHtml` during Slides traversal, then mirrors the small
`slidesMain` output loop.
