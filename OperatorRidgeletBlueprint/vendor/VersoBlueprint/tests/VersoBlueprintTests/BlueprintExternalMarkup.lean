This showcase models a Blueprint that is being migrated from an imported paper.
The visible text is the current informal Blueprint layer. The MD and TeX badges
in Blueprint headers mark original source markup that is attached to the same
label, even when that source is not shown inline.

There are three layers in play:

- the original source pages and extracted markup;
- the informal Blueprint node, which may already be native Verso or may still be
  bodyless;
- the Lean declarations attached with `(lean := ...)`.

# Native Blueprint text with imported witnesses

This first node has a normal Verso body. The source witnesses are review data:
the header advertises that Markdown and TeX are attached, while the body remains
the curated Blueprint text.

:::definition "showcase.visible.attachments" (lean := "Nat.add") (tags := "external-source,mixed-markup,native-body")
A native Verso Blueprint node can carry external Markdown and TeX witnesses. The
source markup remains available to the manifest and preview cache, but it does
not replace the authored Blueprint body.
:::

```md "showcase.visible.attachments" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-12.md") (start_line := 4) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 9) (end_character := 0)
**Imported statement.** This Markdown witness is attached to a native Blueprint
node, so the rendered header shows an MD badge while the visible body remains
the curated Verso text.
```

```tex "showcase.visible.attachments" (slot := proof) (path := "source/imported-paper.tex") (start_line := 42) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 46) (end_character := 0)
\begin{proof}
This proof witness is kept as imported TeX while the Blueprint statement is
being reviewed.
\end{proof}
```

# Bodyless Markdown statement with Lean declarations

This theorem is not native Verso yet. The theorem directive intentionally has no
body, but it still has source provenance, imported Markdown, and Lean
declarations. The preview manifest must therefore keep the source and Lean data
on the external-markup entry.

:::theorem "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1" (lean := "Nat.add, Nat.mul") (tags := "external-source,markdown-only,bodyless")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "12"
      text := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-12.md"
        startLine := 4
        endLine := 15
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-12.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-12.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%
:::

```md "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-12.md") (start_line := 4) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 15) (end_character := 0)
# Theorem 2.1

For every natural number $n$, the imported source states that addition and
multiplication have canonical recursive behavior.

- Source text is Markdown, not Verso.
- The Blueprint node is intentionally bodyless.
- Lean declarations are still attached to the manifest entry.
```

# Selected Markdown preview with TeX alongside

When a bodyless node has more than one source witness, the generator must choose
one witness for the rendered preview body. This example carries both Markdown
and TeX statement witnesses. The default render preference chooses Markdown for
the preview body, while the header badges still show that both source formats
are attached.

:::theorem "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1.SelectedMarkdown" (lean := "Nat.add") (tags := "external-source,mixed-markup,selected-markdown,bodyless")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[

        endLine := 26

        path := "source/pages/page-12.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-12.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:selected-markdown}
This TeX statement is attached, but it is not the selected rendered preview body
when Markdown is also available in the statement slot.
\end{theorem}
```

```md "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1.SelectedMarkdown" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-12.md") (start_line := 16) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 26) (end_character := 0)
## Selected Markdown statement

This Markdown witness is selected for the rendered preview body even though a
TeX statement witness is attached to the same node.
```

# Authored labels with punctuation

Imported papers often carry labels such as `Chapter4:Theorem4.2.1` or
`ImportedPaper:Theorem2.2`. The canonical Lean `Name` is useful internally, but
the manifest also preserves the raw authored label for user interfaces.

:::theorem "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.2" (lean := "Nat.add") (tags := "external-source,markdown-only,raw-label")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "13"
      text := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-13.md"
        startLine := 1
        endLine := 8
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-13.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-13.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%
:::

```md "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.2" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-13.md") (start_line := 1) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 8) (end_character := 0)
## Theorem 2.2

This second bodyless node uses a punctuation-heavy authored label. The manifest
keeps the raw label and the external Markdown source separately from the Lean
name used for generated declaration previews.
```

# Bodyless TeX statement

Some imports start from TeX rather than Markdown. This node has no native Verso
body and no Markdown witness, but it still gets a TeX badge, source provenance,
and a Lean declaration preview.

:::definition "ImportedPaper:Definition2.3" (lean := "Nat.mul") (tags := "external-source,tex-only,bodyless")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "14"
      text := some {
        path := "source/imported-paper.tex"
        startLine := 88
        endLine := 96
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-14.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-14.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%
:::

```tex "ImportedPaper:Definition2.3" (slot := statement) (path := "source/imported-paper.tex") (start_line := 88) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 96) (end_character := 0)
\begin{definition}\label{def:imported-multiplication}
The imported TeX source defines the multiplication operation used by the later
results in this section.
\end{definition}
```

# Multi-page source provenance

Source provenance may point at more than one page. The external markup witness
is a compact Markdown extraction, while the source metadata records both PDF
pages that reviewers should inspect.

:::theorem "ImportedPaper:Proposition2.4" (lean := "Nat.add, Nat.mul") (uses := "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1") (tags := "external-source,multi-page,bodyless")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "15"
      text := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-15.md"
        startLine := 20
        endLine := 39
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-15.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-15.png"
      }
    },
    {
      page := "16"
      text := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-16.md"
        startLine := 1
        endLine := 8
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-16.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-16.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%
:::

```md "ImportedPaper:Proposition2.4" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-15.md") (start_line := 20) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 39) (end_character := 0)
### Proposition 2.4

The imported Markdown extraction summarizes a result whose source spans two
pages. The manifest keeps both source spans, while this witness records the
textual extraction used for review.
```

# Native rewrite after review

After review, an imported item can be rewritten as normal Blueprint prose while
keeping the original source witness attached for auditability.

:::theorem "showcase.native.rewrite" (lean := "Nat.add") (uses := "ImportedPaper:Theorem2.1") (tags := "external-source,native-body,reviewed")
%%%
source := {
  document := "imported-paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "17"
      text := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-17.md"
        startLine := 11
        endLine := 20
      }
      pdf := some {
        path := "source/pages/page-17.pdf"
        image := some "source/pages/images/page-17.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
%%%

The reviewed theorem is now expressed directly in Verso. Its Markdown badge
shows that the imported source is still connected to the node for comparison and
future audits.
:::

```md "showcase.native.rewrite" (slot := statement) (path := "source/pages/page-17.md") (start_line := 11) (start_character := 0) (end_line := 20) (end_character := 0)
## Reviewed theorem

This is the original Markdown extraction for a theorem that now has native
Blueprint prose.
```

# Summary surface

The summary below is included so the showcase has a review surface as well as
individual node headers. It should retain labels, source-backed nodes, Lean
status, and relationships for nodes whose visible body still comes from
