/-! # The Leshno (1993) activation class `M` and polynomial predicates.

This is the first file of the top-down Leshno universal-approximation scaffold. It defines:

* `ClassM σ` — the activation class `M`: `σ` is locally bounded and the closure of its
  discontinuity set is Lebesgue-null;
* `IsAEPolynomial σ` — `σ` agrees Lebesgue-a.e. with a polynomial function (the M-boundary
  notion);
* `IsPolynomialFun σ` — `σ` equals a polynomial function everywhere (the smooth-layer notion);
* `ClassM.of_continuous` — every continuous `σ` is in `M`;
* `isPolynomialFun_of_continuous_of_aePolynomial` — a continuous a.e.-polynomial is an everywhere
  polynomial (bridges the two notions for the smooth engine).
