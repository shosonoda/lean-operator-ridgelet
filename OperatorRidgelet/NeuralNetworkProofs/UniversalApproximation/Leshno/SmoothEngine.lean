/-! # The univariate smooth derivative-trick engine for the Leshno UAT.

This file works abstractly on `C(↥I, ℝ)` for a compact real set `I`, with the (closed) span of
all dilated/translated copies of a fixed `g : ℝ → ℝ`. The univariate target of the Leshno (1993)
universal-approximation theorem, in its smooth-activation reduction, is the statement that the
closure of this span is everything (`⊤`) whenever `g` is smooth and not (everywhere) a polynomial.

* `Sg g I hg` — the `ℝ`-submodule of `C(↥I, ℝ)` spanned by `t ↦ g (λ t + b)` over all `(λ, b)`;
* `deriv_pow_mem` (B1, **leaf**) — `t ↦ tᵏ · g⁽ᵏ⁾(λ t + b)` lies in the closure of `Sg g`;
* `exists_deriv_ne` (B2) — a smooth non-polynomial has a nonzero `k`-th derivative for each `k`;
* `smooth_engine` (B3, glue) — the closed span is all of `C(↥I, ℝ)`.

/-- B1 (leaf). For smooth `g`, the function `t ↦ tᵏ · g⁽ᵏ⁾(λt+b)` lies in the closure of `Sg g`.

Proved by induction on `k` (generalizing `λ, b`). The base case is a generator of `Sg g`. For the
step, with `G := g⁽ᵏ⁾`, the difference quotients `D_s := s⁻¹ · (Φ_{λ+s} − Φ_λ)`, where
`Φ_μ(t) = tᵏ · G(μ t + b)` is the `k`-case map (in `closure (Sg g)` by the IH at dilation `μ`), lie
in `closure (Sg g)` since it is a submodule. As `s → 0` they converge **uniformly on the compact
`I`** to `Ψ(t) = tᵏ⁺¹ · g⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾(λt+b)`: a per-point Taylor/MVT bound (`taylor_seg_bound`, via
`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasDerivWithin_le`) plus uniform continuity of `G'` on a compact
interval containing every `λt+b` give a uniform error estimate. As `closure (Sg g)` is closed
(`Submodule.isClosed_topologicalClosure`), the limit `Ψ` lies in it (`IsClosed.mem_of_tendsto`
along `sₙ = 1/(n+1)`). -/
